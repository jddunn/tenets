## Quick Start

For implementation details and usage examples, refer to the individual architecture documents. Each component is designed to work independently while contributing to the overall system intelligence.

## Architecture Principles

1. **Privacy by Design**: No code leaves the local environment
2. **Performance First**: Optimized for speed and efficiency
3. **Extensibility**: Modular design for easy enhancement
4. **Developer Experience**: Intuitive interfaces and comprehensive tooling

The future of code intelligence is local, intelligent, and developer-centric. Tenets embodies this vision while remaining practical and immediately useful for development teams of any size.
