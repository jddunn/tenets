# Tenets - MCP Server for Intelligent Code Context

> Context that feeds your prompts

## What is Tenets?

Tenets is a free, open-source MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, CLI tool, and Python library that provides intelligent code context for AI coding assistants.

## Two Core Features

1. **Intelligent Code Context Aggregation**: NLP-powered file ranking (BM25, TF-IDF, import centrality, git signals) finds and aggregates the most relevant code for any task.

2. **Automatic Guiding Principles Injection**: Define tenets (guiding principles) that are automatically injected into every prompt, preventing context drift in long conversations.

## Quick Install

```bash
pip install tenets[mcp]
```

## MCP Configuration

For Cursor IDE (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):
```json
{"mcpServers": {"tenets": {"command": "tenets-mcp"}}}
```

For Claude Desktop (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{"mcpServers": {"tenets": {"command": "tenets-mcp"}}}
```

## Key MCP Tools

- `distill`: Build optimized code context for a task
- `rank_files`: Preview file relevance scores
- `examine`: Analyze codebase structure and complexity
- `session_create`: Create stateful development sessions
- `tenet_add`: Add guiding principles for consistency
- `tenet_instill`: Activate tenets for injection
